 # Features:
   * Service Container
   
   * View Composers
     * View Composers come in very handy for "automatically" attaching data to views. This allows you to pull in views without worrying about 
     proving the necessary data to make it work.
     
   * Polymorphic Relationships
        * Polymorphism is just a fancy word for the concept that objects can take different shapes as long as they follow the same interface.
        
   * Facade
   
   * Macros
     * Macros allow you to add functions to many of the built in classes in Laravel using a Service Provider or a dedicated class

   * Pipelines
      * Pipeline is a design pattern specifically optimized to handle stepped changes to an object. Think of an assembly line, where each step is a pipe and by the end of the line, you have your transformed object.
           
   * Repository Pattern
      * The Repository Pattern is a common refactor that you may encounter in large Laravel applications. While it is not ideal for small to medium projects, it's a perfect solution for those applications that need an abstraction of the data layer.
